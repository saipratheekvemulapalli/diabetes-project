# diabetes-project
Diabetes has become one of the major causes of death. Based on that, I have designed a project for predicting whether a person has diabetes or not and also predicting the severity of the disease at an early stage based on parameters such as glucose, blood pressure, and insulin levels, which are taken as inputs. It is a supervised machine learning algorithm that uses a dataset for prediction. At first, user input is taken on the screen. With the help of a training dataset, it predicts and displays whether the user has diabetes or not. These are the machine learning algorithms that are used in my project: boosting, gradient boost, XGboost and cat boost.
